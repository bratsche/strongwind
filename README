Strongwind is a GUI test automation framework inspired by dogtail.  Strongwind
is object-oriented and extensible. You can use Strongwind to build
object-oriented representations of your applications ("application wrappers"),
then reuse the application wrappers to quickly develop many test scripts.
Strongwind scripts generate a human-readable log that contains the action,
expected result and a screen shot of each step.  Most simple actions are logged
automatically.

Strongwind is written in Python and uses the pyatspi library to manipulate and
query the state of applications. Strongwind automatically classifies widgets by
their ATK role. By default, Strongwind provides implementations for common
actions on regular widgets -- for example, selecting an item in a menu or
asserting that a window has closed -- but you can extend Strongwind's
implementations or add your own implementations for custom widgets to handle
alternate behaviors or custom widgets in your applications.
